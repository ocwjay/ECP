# ECP
ECP is a portfolio page helper for the lazy developer.
<br />
ECP stands for Easy Card Portfolio. It is meant to be used on a website for someone who needs a portfolio, such as a developer, artist, muscian, really any freelancing or professional individual trying to make their own website. This is especially geared towards helping developers create an easy portfolio page by typing less code overall. 
<br />
# Benefits of using ECP
Developers like to use less code, so they can get jobs done faster. <br />
ECP allows developers to create a portfolio page with the absolute minimum code needed. It's designed to be plug and play, and works with any framework due to being coded fully in pure JavaScript and CSS. A developer using ECP will basically input all of the divs needed for a portfolio page, with an image and a title, and ECP will take care of the rest.
